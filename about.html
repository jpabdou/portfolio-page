        <h2>I'm a chemist studying web development. I have worked for 8 years in various chemistry roles from an analytical chemist characterizing the sugar 
            content in food and beverage ingredients to a research scientist studying chemical sensors at NASA. Throughout my career, I greatly enjoy solving problems. However, I 
            found myself drawn to coding when I applied my knowledge of Python in script projects at work. My enjoyment in developing code to solve problems encouraged me to make 
            a career change into web development by studying Full-Stack Web Development at BloomTech.</h2>
