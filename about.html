        <h2>I'm a Chemistry major turned web developer. I studied Bachelors and Masters in Chemistry and then for 8 years, I have worked in various chemistry roles from an analytical chemist characterizing the sugar content in food and beverage ingredients to researching chemical sensors at NASA. I greatly enjoy solving problems in my roles, but I found myself reaching the limits on advancing my career with highly impactful work. I studied Python on the side and my enjoyment of working on Python script projects during my work encouraged me to make a career change into web development by studying Full-Stack Web Development at BloomTech.</h2>
